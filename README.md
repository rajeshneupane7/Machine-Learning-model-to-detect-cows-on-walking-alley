# Machine-Learning-model-to-detect-cows-on-walking-alley
This project uses tensorflow convulutional neural network to determine cows and non-cows in waliking alley of animal farm.
This is a primary model and not quite efficient in predicting of cows and non-cows in the alley
However,this is used as baseline model for classfication problem in computer vision for a specific part of a farm.

I am thankful for data provided by Institute of Agricultural Engineering, kiel University
